House Price Prediction

Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to develop an interactive machine learning model that predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. This project serves as a practical application of data science concepts and provides valuable insights into the real estate market.

 Key Features
- Data Exploration: Utilize Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize and analyze historical housing data, identifying trends and patterns that impact house prices.
- Model Development: Implement machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on input features.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared, ensuring the predictions are accurate and reliable.
- Interactive Front-End: Create a user-friendly interface using Jupyter Notebook widgets that allows users to input various parameters and instantly receive predicted house prices. This enhances the user experience and makes complex analyses accessible.

Technical Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy for numerical computations
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
